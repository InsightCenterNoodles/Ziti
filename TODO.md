# TODO

- Gestures for motion
- Alternative gestures for scene navigation
    - Needed for IMM
    - HandTrackingProvider
- Plot support
- Table support
- Scene inspection support


## Other Notes

- Color attribs not well supported in vertex
- instances only really support positions
    - how to add in color?
- Are we actually closing the connection and removing resources on window close?
